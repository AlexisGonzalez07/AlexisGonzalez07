<h2 align="center"> Hey, Iâ€™m Alex!</h2>
<p align="center"> I don't want to just use applications, I want to make them. </p>

After years of learning modeling and optimization in Excel, I knew I had a great understanding of how to organize, manipulate, and analyze data. I  always had an interest for coding and web design, so last year I decided to learn the skillset necessary in order to become a web developer. I've put in the work, and I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities as a full stack web developer.

I strive to deliver great user experiences in all my applications, which is why I take pride in the fact that I meticulously think about my code and application structure before I type a single line of code. I have a great understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern, and I leverage that knowledge to create organized, well-structured applications that are easy for other coders to dissect. This style of programming has enabled me to become a great collaborator, and it's a skill that I continue to work on and improve daily. I have some personal passion projects I'd like to code, and I'm always open to working with other developers in their personal endeavors as well. Whether you're a recruiter, a developer, or simply passing through, I hope you find pleasure in using my apps.

## Education 
I'm a firm believer that no matter what, one must never stop learning, growing, and taking on new endeavors. 

I graduated with a BBA in Business Administration at the Red McCombs School of Business in May 2019 with a major in Supply Chain Management and a minor in Finance. I gained valuable knowledge in logistics, warehousing, strategic management, procurement, project management, and modeling/optimization. I also gained the ability to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to make optimal investment and operational decisions. I fell in love with data management, numbers, and solving problems, but as a first-generation college graduate I was burnt out. Within a year COVID happened, and after trying my luck with some personal projects and a ton of YouTube videos, I began to explore the world of coding...

I recently obtained a certificate from the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin in December of 2021. I'm so excited to take the skills I developed in those three months to the workplace. Although I had seen a lot about coding and software development, it wasn't until I got my first assignment that I ever opened up Visual Studio Code and typed my first line of code: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```. Since then, I've worked on over 18 small projects, wrote my first gist, and collaborated on three applications with a talented team of developers (all three projects pinned below!). I still remember how tough it was to write my first code quiz, and how it was even tougher to style it after spending hours writing a script. But the growth pains made me a better coder, and there's still a long journey ahead of me. I may have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, SQL, React, MongoDB, RESTful APIs and other beautiful things in software development, but there's still Python, C, C#, Swift and other languages to learn - not to mention the thousands of component libraries and front-end frameworks out in the wild.

I shall continue learining and hopefully, give back to some of you reading some day.
