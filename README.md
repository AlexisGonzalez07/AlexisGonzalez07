<h2 align="center"> Hey, Iâ€™m Alex!</h2>   

I've decided to become a software developer in order to understand how the technologies I use everyday function. I don't want to just use them, I want to make them.

## Education 
I'm a firm believer that no matter what, one must never stop learning, growing, and taking on new endeavors. 

I attended The University of Texas at Austin's Red McCombs School of Business where I graduated in May of 2019 with a BBA in Supply Chain Management and a minor in Finance. 
Graduated with a BBA in Business Administration at the Red McCombs School of Business in May 2019 with a major in Supply Chain Management and a minor in Finance. I gained valuable knowledge in logistics, warehousing, strategic management, procurement, project management, and modeling/optimization. I also gained the ability to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to make optimal investment and operational decisions. I fell in love with data management, numbers, and solving problems, but as a first-generation college graduate I was burnt out. Within a year COVID happened, and after trying my luck with some personal projects and a ton of YouTube videos, I began to explore the world of coding...

I recently obtained a certificate from the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin
Iâ€™ve developed strong analytical and leadership skills that enable me to implement positive change in business results and culture. These experiences have prepared me to work and thrive in a professional setting.
